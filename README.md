Statistical Modeling Projects ‚Äì MITx MicroMasters
This repository contains a collection of statistical modeling projects developed as part of MITx 6.419x: Data Analysis ‚Äì Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications, a core course in the MITx MicroMasters Program in Data Science and Statistics.

Overview
These projects demonstrate applied skills in:

Probability and Statistical Inference

Bayesian and Frequentist Modeling

Data Analysis and Simulation

Model Evaluation and Interpretation

Each project reflects the use of real-world data and statistical computation to address complex analytical tasks, highlighting both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using Python.
